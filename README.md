# PROJECT AUDD
The Australian Digital Dollar Drawing Board
The AUDD - Australian Digital Dollar is being created to provide every single Australian Citizen the ability to begin a relationship with a Finance Provider/System  provider no matter how good or bad your Credit Score.
Why create the AUDD Crypto?
I have plenty of reasons to bring this to fruition but my main motivation comes from my own experiences of being broke & Homeless in themiddle of Winter surviving the streets through Sub-Zero . 
The way I see this vision unfolding is that all you will need to do is prove that you exist via a KYC Program.
From then on you are beginning your relationship with the system with a clean slate, the rest is up to you.
NO INTEREST ON OUR LOANS.
NO ANNUAL FEES.
Once you pass the ID Verification, there is no further requirement by you to be abe to access your Loan funds.
You begin with a $50/$100 Lending Limit with Good Credit Ratings awarded higher lending rates.
You will be able to invest into the AUDD system using various Decentralised Financial Products & Services.
We will endeavour to provide as many methods of payment as quickly as I can but to begin with it'sa solo show until I find some AUDD Project Enthusiasts to join my AUDD team.

I will add more to the Description soon but for now I have to go out and about for a few hours.

Cheers
Chris
